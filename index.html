                <p class="col-sm-10" id="descript">While working for Anytime Fitness as a Certified Personal Trainer I had to handle the personal information of 40+ clients.  This information included fitness goals, work schedule, previous injuries and other health information, sometimes including medications and surgeries.  To maintain a working knowledge of each client I developed simple organization of files and notes to keep track of each clients progress, and adapt their training plans as neccessary.</p>

                <p class="col-sm-10" id="descript">While working through my degree at Winona State University I took part in the schools Barbell Club.  I began powerlifting, and started setting goals for myself.  While lifting I also learned about goal planning as part of my degree so I could help others plan their goals and acheive them.  I learned how to apply SMART goals to any situation, and still to this day use SMART goals to achieve my own.</p>

                <p class="col-sm-10" id="descript">While working at Lane Bryant as the sole stock associate, with my direct report being only the store manager, I had a lot of freedom to determine how I accomplished the duties of my job.  With this freedom I developed new and original processes for handling shipment that were well recieved by regional management and later implemented in other stores in the region.  One example was a process for storing online orders so that locating product and filling orders was made simple.</p>

            <div class="row round-bottom" id="info">
                <p class="col-sm-10" id="descript">My whole life I have sought out opportunities to solve problems, whether they were my own or belonged to others.  A recent example involed developing a way of tying pocket mirrors to the tops of mason jars with ribbon for bridal shower party favors.  With all the materials being slippery, it was difficult to find a secure and aesthetic way of accomplishing the task.  After a couple minutes of playing around with the materials, trying to find a proof of concept, I figured out that the ribbon could be run under the mason jar lid and inside the compact mirror to ensure the ribbon would be tight enough to hold the compact mirrors in place and hide the ribbon so that the aesthetic could remain simple.</p>
